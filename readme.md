# video-scripts

The content of this repo can be read from its
[github.io page](http://tylerneylon.github.io/video-scripts/).

For now, this contains the script for a single video, *Learn Lua in an Hour*.

I made a git repo for video scripts because I'd like to invite people to collaboratively
suggest improvements. This model is somewhere between a wikipedia page and emailing
suggestions to the author of a textbook. I retain more control over the script than
a wikipedia author, but I hope to be more responsive than a textbook author!
I invite pull requests with script changes that:

* keep the script length about the same (or shorter!),
* keep the spirit and scope of the material about the same, and
* improve either the clarity or correctness of the material.

My plan is to eventually add a few more video scripts here as well.
